Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year in addition to the daily and weekly communication between teachers and parents.

                       Children experience numerous special programs and activities on a regular basis.  Our music program holds classes weekly and participate in songs and rhythms that utilize instruments. Children learn music theory in a joyful, engaging, interactive manner. Movement, offered weekly to all classes, emphasizes gross motor skills and cooperative play. Children work on developmental skills such as balance, hopping, skipping, jumping, coordination, spatial awareness, and other essential components of physical education. Spanish occurs in the four and five day classes for Fours and Young 5s.
