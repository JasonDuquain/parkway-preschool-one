MAKE SURE ALL IMG PATHS IN THE SCSS FILES HAVE PATHS THAT WORK FOR THE CSS FILE (../ INSTEAD OF ../../)!!!!

all paths in nav menu should not have a / in front of them (a href="aboutus.html" instead of a href="/aboutus.html")

the slick slider was causing some horizontal overflow due to the right arrow!!




do they want a google maps sect/area? 

child font that is not too comicy: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans it is used on the page with the paintbrush underlines
