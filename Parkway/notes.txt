MAKE SURE ALL IMG PATHS IN THE SCSS FILES HAVE PATHS THAT WORK FOR THE CSS FILE (../ INSTEAD OF ../../)!!!!

all paths in nav menu should not have a / in front of them (a href="aboutus.html" instead of a href="/aboutus.html")

the slick slider was causing some horizontal overflow due to the right arrow!!



OPTIMIZE AND RENAME APPLICABLE IMAGES

remove font weight variants from lato on each page that arent being used!!!

REMOVE GOOGLE FONTS AND ANY JQUERY OR JS FRAMEWORK THAT IS NOT USED ON A SPECIFIC PAGE


when changing colors of PNGs in photoshop select the colorize option to choose custom HSL values..but still need to figure out how to change to exact HSL values from CSS (ex: HSL(219, 70%, 35%))

add a chat-bubble icon to above the 'contact us' heading of the form

WATCH THE CARD HEIGHTS ON THE CLASSES PAGE - ON WORK BROWSER THEY ARE EXTREMELY TALL!!!
